## Frontend Guidelines

- Use appropriate accessibility attributes (for example, meaningful images must have an `alt` attribute, and interactive controls should use ARIA attributes such as `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby`) and ensure color contrast meets WCAG requirements.
- Use responsive design for compatibility with mobile devices.
- Validate HTML structure and semantic elements.
